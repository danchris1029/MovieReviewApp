# MovieReviewApp
Project created during my Object Oriented Programming class at Texas State University.

# Functionality
This program takes a list of movie reviews and stores them into a database. A user-interface in a command line module is used to either search for an ID, or a specfic substring of a review in the database. Fetched reviews are sent to the output so that the user may view them. Deleting reviews by ID or substring has also been implemented.
